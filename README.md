# Weather Cards

Similar to my previous project of building a Social Card, this one is based on Weather cards.

Weather Cards are beautiful UI components to display stats of 5 days, starting from today.

The cards display the minimum and maximum temperatures of the particular day.

This SPA also has a graph which displays hourly temperatures for the day.

The data is dummy and not real. It is made up just for the sake of development and the fact that I couldn't workout the openweather API.

Click the cards to view the graph of different days.

PS: The project is only for the sake of practice in React and building reusable React componenets
